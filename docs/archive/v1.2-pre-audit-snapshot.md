**Context:** This content was archived after the consolidated audit (AUDIT-FINAL-2026-02-15.md) revealed P0/P1 issues that needed to be prioritized. The tasks below represent the original v1.2.0 plan before audit remediation became the focus.

**Status at Archive Time:** Toast Notification Enhancements completed. 4 remaining UX tasks (Keyboard Shortcuts, Bulk Operations, CSV Template Downloads, Advanced Filtering) re-prioritized to v1.3.0 after audit fixes.

## Definition of "Production Ready" (At Archive Time)

The frontend is **production ready** when:

- [x] All CRUD operations work
- [x] CSV import functional
- [x] Reports generate correctly
- [x] PDF downloads work
- [x] Forms are validated
- [x] Error states handled gracefully
- [x] Loading states prevent confusion
- [x] Responsive on mobile
- [x] Keyboard accessible
- [x] Tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
- [x] Docker deployment configured
- [x] Documentation complete

**Status at Archive Time:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

The remaining 5 tasks are nice-to-have polish items that do not block daily use.

**Note:** The audit revealed one P0 data correctness bug (bizPercent double-application in CSV import) that means the "production ready" assessment was premature. BAS numbers for CSV-imported expenses with bizPercent < 100 were incorrect.
