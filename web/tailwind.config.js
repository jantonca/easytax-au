/**
 * Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
 *
 * Note:
 *  - The primary Tailwind config for the web app now lives in CSS
 *    via `@import "tailwindcss";` and `@plugin "tailwindcss-animate";`
 *    in `src/index.css`.
 *  - This file is kept minimal for tooling that expects a tailwind.config file.
 *  - If needed later, we can reintroduce JS-based config via the `@config` directive
 *    in CSS, but for now everything is driven from CSS for the modern v4 flow.
